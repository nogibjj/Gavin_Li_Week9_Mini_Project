## Google Colab

[Here is the link for my Jupyter Notebook file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AX91nExsTbxolOcUMSG3dFysssKby7oF)

## Data manipulation and visualization

The dataset used in this project is the kaggle Titanic training dataset.

The dataset is grouped by gender, then a mean of survived variable is calculated for each group to compare the survival rate.

A plot is then made to visualize the survival rate.

Here is the plot
